"""Serve the React propagation frontend at /propagation_app.

The bundle itself is built by ``frontend/`` (Vite) into
``upande_propagation/public/dist``; this page is the shell Frappe renders around
it. It does three things and nothing else:

* resolve the hashed entry filenames from Vite's manifest, so a new build busts
  the browser cache by URL rather than by a query string. A ``?v=`` suffix on
  the entry script would create two distinct module URLs — chunks import the
  entry by its bare hashed name while the <script> tag would carry the query —
  and the browser would instantiate React twice, crashing hooks;
* inline who is looking at it (name, roles, CSRF token) so the app does not pay
  a round-trip before its first paint;
* send Guest to the login page.

No data is prefetched here: each page asks for its own through the
upande_propagation.api methods.
